subtitle: Lightweight Standards and Patterns for (Open) Data
layout: default
---

This site is the home of **simple protocols and formats for working
with open data**. Our mission is both to make it **easier to develop
tools and services for working with data**, and, to ensure **greater
interoperability between new and existing tools and services**.

Work topics include:

- Simple formats for facilitating data exchange over the web
- Web-oriented data APIs including those for accessing and querying data
- An overview of sharing and syncing data changes
- Webhooks and webservices for data transformation
- Data catalog interoperability - see the [Data Catalog Interoperability
  Protocol](http://spec.datacatalogs.org/)

Background and Context
======================

The civic and open data community is often hampered by a lack of simple
standards for interaction between services and tools.

We believe there is a clear need for the kinds of lightweight but useful
protocols and formats for doing things like:

-   Sharing information between data catalogs
-   Sharing and syncing data changes over HTTP
-   Querying data and databases over the web
-   Creating web services for data transformation and reconciliation

DataProtocols isn't a formal standardization process like W3C, ISO or
OASIS, but rather is aiming to be a more informal community where we can
hammer out RFCs for data - rough consensus, running code and integrated
data (and building wherever possible on what already exists).

We believe consensus needs to come from a community not just a single
vendor or organization and the user and developer community is now
developed enough to take this on and make it happen.

Moreover, technology and especially web technology has reached the point
where this is both feasible and needed - be that in terms of standards,
use of HTTP and REST, browser maturity, or, in terms of ad-hoc
development in tools that is ripe for "standardization".

{% capture initial_contributors %}
Data Protocols was started in Autumn 2011 and arose out of discussions
with, among others, Rufus Pollock and Friedrich Lindenberg of the [Open
Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/), Francis Irving and Aidan
McGuire of [ScraperWiki](http://scraperwiki.com/), Max Ogden (then a
[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.com/) fellow), Chris Taggart of
[OpenCorporates](http://opencorporates.com/), Richard Cyganiak of
[DERI](http://www.deri.ie/) and members of the W3C GLD Working Group.
Paul Fitzpatrick of the [Data Commons Co-op](http://datacommons.coop)
has helped out.{% endcapture %}
